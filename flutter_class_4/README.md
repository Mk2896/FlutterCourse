# flutter_class_4

A new Flutter project for Class 4.

## Class Content

- Images
    - **AssetImage** for using it you first have to add in pubsec.yaml.
    - **NetworkImage** for rendering url images.
    - **Image.asset** same as AssetImage.
    - **Image.network** same as NetworkImage.

- Navigation
    - Study different type of navigator methods by yourself.

- Constants
    - Its a better practice to make separate folder for colors or text constants and use it in a class so code is dry.

- State use for updating UI of StatefulWidget **SetState()**

- **Stack** used for placing one widget over another. It is used with **positioned** to align the second widget above the first one.
